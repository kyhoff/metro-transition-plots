This code is associated with [Mixed Metro](http://mixedmetro.com), a collaborative and longitudinal project 
between Dartmouth College, the University of Washington, and the University of Georgia.
The intention of these plots is to visualize decadal changes and patterns in racial diversity and segregation in metropoltian areas in the United States.
